            eventually meet, in which there is no center because every point, or none, is center â€” an equal
            earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it, will be truly
            round: a globe in practice, not in theory.</p>
        <p>Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good and evil. But there's no
            turning back from science. The early warnings about technological dangers also come from
            science.</p>
        <p>What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that
            they set eye on the earth.</p>
        <p>A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become
            her protectors rather than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time.
